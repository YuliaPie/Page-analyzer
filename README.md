About

This web application is designed to assess the SEO-friendliness of websites online. It provides users with a simple yet powerful tool to evaluate the SEO readiness of any website they're interested in. By entering the URL of the site, the application performs a series of checks to ensure the input is valid and then proceeds to make an HTTP request to the entered website.

The application extracts key information about the website from this HTTP request, including heading, page title, status code and description.
